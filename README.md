myMediCon: A Medical Conversation Corpus for the Myanmar Language, designed for both text and speech.  

## Text Corpus 

The myMediCon corpus is a contribution by LU Lab., Myanmar, addressing the need for medical-domain resources in Myanmar language NLP research and development (R&D). After initially preparing the text data, the speech data was also processed and refined.

The text corpus is based on conversations between doctors and patients, derived from the English book titled "Samson Handbook of PLAB 2 and Clinical Assessment" written by Dr. Samson Chissi, MD, which is intended for clinical examinations. These English sentences were manually translated into Myanmar language. To avoid copyright issues, the English sentences were paraphrased using Quillbot software instead of being used verbatim. Additionally, the English sentences from the book were translated into Thai using Google Translate. As a result, the English and Thai data can be considered, in a way, synthesized data.

The file information for the myMediCon text corpus (version 0.8) is as follows:

Main Contributors
The development of this text corpus is part of the master's degree thesis by Mya Ei San (SIIT, Thammasat University, Thailand), titled "Machine Translation for Low-Resource Thai-English-Myanmar Language Pairs".  

Ye Kyaw Thu served as the supervisor for this project.  

## Speech Corpus  

Work in progress. Currently, we have published one paper related to the myMediCon speech corpus:
